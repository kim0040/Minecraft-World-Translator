# PomiTranslate support matrix

This file is generated from fixture results. A format is supported only when its fixture passed.
Detected formats below are not writable. Platform rows mean release support is unverified.

Fixtures use small synthetic worlds. A passing row means that shape is read and written correctly.
It does not mean every player-visible text in a real world is found.

## Scope

Core fixtures: `region` and `entities` folders of each dimension, and `resources.zip` inside the world when enabled.
Desktop also handles explicitly selected external ZIPs; see [user guide](user-guide.md) and [current evidence](current-state.md).
Not scanned: data packs, `data/*.dat` (command storage, scoreboard), `level.dat` and player data.
